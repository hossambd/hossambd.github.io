### Introduction

This project is a vanilla Bootstrap and PHP-based booking platform designed for streamlined session scheduling and administration. The front end utilizes clean Bootstrap styling while the back end is powered by a structured custom PHP API, which integrates with a Java-based Bookit system for seamless cross-platform coordination.

The booking system uses GET methods for simplicity, alongside front-end and back-end token validation to prevent duplicate bookings within the same session. For administration, a FullCalendar.js interface allows for real-time appointment management, with an optional Google Calendar integration in development to offer flexible syncing and alternate administrative access.

Additional tools include PHPMailer for transactional email handling and google-api-php-client for managing calendar synchronization. The system emphasizes clarity, reliability, and modularity—ideal for solo practitioners or small teams seeking a lightweight, custom booking solution. Please visit https://zackly-rite.ca
