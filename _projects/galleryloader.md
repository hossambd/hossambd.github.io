Image Lazy Load Angular.js 1.5 of Studio Images folder IO App 

Exploring Java and ***Angular.js 1.5*** sends a json response using ***IntersectionObserver*** with file image structure parsing for masonry layout front end using angular methods and delegates
An image Gallery with masonry design, reads a folder from the directory category structures: 
- example: studio-1/{size}/images/
- example2: studio-2/{size}/images/

It is a simple exploration of reading images to display their imagery based on the size of the images. It is simple to serve only reasonable size images to fit screens in general however can be expanded upon to deliver different size based on the device screens read from the user to utilize performance of image rendering.
The difference between this app and the lazy-image-loader is that this unit of code base does not include jsp pages of rendering the content. It is a pure angular.js integration. 

{% raw %}
```java
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		
		String action = request.getParameter("action");
		
		if(action == null) {
			action = "LIST";
		}
		
		switch(action) {
            //the nugget we're working on.
			case "GALLERY":
				listStudioImages(request,response);
				break;
            ....    
        }
}        
```
{% endraw %}

When called, the service sends back json image list package to render the page with appropriate image size based on user devices, Java framework coupled with Angular.js  and masonry framework integrations implementation. 

{% raw %}
```html
<body ng-app="lazy" ng-controller="AppController">
	<div class="flex-container">	
		<div class="block" ngClass="block" ng-repeat="s in studioImages" lazy-load>							    	
	    		<img class="w-100" ng-src="{{s.imgUrl}}" alt="{{studioName}}" > 						    	
	    </div>	
	</div>
</body>
```
{% endraw %}

Clean and interesting images of the project will be coming soon. 


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
