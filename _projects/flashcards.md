## Introduction FlashcardsApp

## ✅ Why These Questions Are Great for Interviews
## 🔹 Angular / React Questions
Cover essential framework concepts (components, lifecycle, routing, forms, RxJS/hooks)

Interviewers often ask about:

Difference between template-driven and reactive forms

Component communication (@Input, @Output, context, props)

Routing/navigation and programmatic control

Structural directives or JSX patterns

RxJS / useEffect logic (real interview pain points)

## 🔹 Java Core
Questions like:

What is garbage collection?

What’s the difference between an interface and abstract class?

What is multithreading, and how do you synchronize threads?

What are collections, and how do you choose between ArrayList and LinkedList?

These hit the heart of what Java interviews test.

## 🔹 Design Principles
MVC, Dependency Injection, and modularity questions show architecture-level thinking

Knowing these puts you in a higher bracket (e.g., senior or systems-oriented roles)

## 🔹 Algorithms & Data Structures
Essential for any coding interview (LeetCode-style problems often revolve around trees, graphs, recursion, etc.)

## 🔹 Tooling
Questions on Angular CLI, React dev tools, Java build tools (Maven/Gradle) are helpful bonus points.

## 🧠 Tip: Interviewers Are Looking For
```
Category	What They Look For
Knowledge	You understand the frameworks, syntax, and API behavior
Problem Solving	You can apply what you know to real-world or whiteboard scenarios
Communication	You explain concepts like DI or GC clearly and confidently
Practicality	You write code efficiently and follow best practices (e.g., not leaking memory)

```


This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.15.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
