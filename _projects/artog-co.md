Unique to Artog 

    -- chatbot integration of photography elements. It is a study of how to integrate new and interesting OpenAI and LLM model implementations.
    -- User Profile sections from a user interface to track invoices and ticketts to the artog.co site modelled from the Adobe user site and an exploration in sales dashboards, faker library and user image gallery layouts and more. 



## Project Image Gallery
The below screenshots capture some of the modules and components built that visually help relate the modules and features designed and implemented within the site. 
They represent some areas that are exclusive the the Artog.co ecosystem. The list and images are non-exhaustive.

    The above set of images are front end displays relative to the code behind for the links to github modules. Some portions rely on static Block content, and RBA like the dashboard for instance.
    On the left we have a photo of the photography_qa module that plays around with chatbot text prompt response methods. It is an exploration module that has different forms and functions. 
    In the middle we have a portion of the user_profile_account interface of gallery image layouts to provide a user with different layout options. 
    On the right the image corresponds to a block placement of what is artog.co.

The sales dashboard is a fun little addition to the user_profile_account. This route displays a mockup of fake customer data that is realistic with weights based on North American average sales. This feature uses a sales service to display the graphs on one page.

    The most interesting section and favorite of artog is its interactive user profile functions. The fake data cron job makes this page always have display sales from a fake generator used in the backend. The dashboard uses charts.js features and options.
