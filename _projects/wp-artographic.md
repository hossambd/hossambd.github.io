I developed a WordPress-based test site to explore the capabilities of the Inspiro theme and its integration with Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) for email marketing automation. The project focuses on evaluating user experience design, theme customization, and plugin compatibility. Key plugins used include GoSMTP for secure email delivery, WPZOOM Forms for form creation and submissions, and Poll Maker alongside Poll for interactive user feedback. This setup provides a lightweight and modular environment to test workflows, design patterns, and marketing integrations in a real-world context. Visit: https://crystalhansenartographic.ca and brows around take a poll. https://crystalhansenartographic.ca/creative-strategy/#ays-poll-container-2

Most interesting development is with the polling of questions pertaining to art, right and left brain thinking

  The polling and process pages are very interesting tools to use with any site. The polling gives the site a way to identify user interest and engagements. The limitation is only one question per poll. Ideally a paging through some questions say 5 or so would be good perhaps a link to a second poll item might be a way to work with this feature.
