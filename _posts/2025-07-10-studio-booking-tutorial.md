# 🎥 Building a Studio Booking App with Angular: A Complete Tutorial

## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to build a front end of a fully functional booking application? In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how we built **Studio Booker**, an Angular-powered stand alone single-page app for managing photography studio bookings — from browsing studios to booking a time slot, managing a cart, and completing checkout with a polished confirmation and PDF receipt. It also includes basic front end user login/signup forms and button for a subsection of this tutuorial.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Angular 17+
- Bootstrap 5
- FullCalendar.js
- Reactive Forms
- LocalStorage for persistence
- html2pdf.js for client-side PDF generation

---

### 🔄 App Flow

#### 1. Studio Listing

The user browses available studios with name, description, accessories, and pricing. Clicking “Book Now” sends studio data to the calendar component.

```ts
  this.router.navigate(['/calendar', id], {{

}});
```

---

#### 2. Calendar View

- Uses FullCalendar.js
- Clicking a day opens a booking form with that date pre-filled
- Clicking an event populates the form with existing booking info

---

3. Booking Form Reactive form with:

- Title
- Date (readonly if selected from calendar)
- Time slot (button selector)
- Price (from studio)

Emits the completed booking object to be added to the cart.

---

4. Cart System

- Displays list of bookings
- Allows item removal
- Calculates total
- Uses LocalStorage for persistence
- Cart is cleared on successful booking confirmation

---

5. Checkout
   Includes:

- First/Last Name, Email, Address
- Promo code validation (EXAMPLECODE)
- Card info and payment method
- Validates form on submission
- Sends booking + user info to the confirmation page.

---

6. Confirmation

- Displays cart summary and confirmation ID
- Downloadable/printable PDF using html2pdf.js
- Clears cart on load

---

#### Key Concepts

- Angular routing (with route/query parameters)
- Component communication via @Input() and @Output()
- FullCalendar integration
- Reactive Forms & validation
- LocalStorage-based cart service
- Hosting Angular on a subdomain with .htaccess
- PDF generation with html2pdf.js

{: .note}
Deployment Notes
Subdomain configured via shared hosting (e.g., HostPapa)
Built using: `ng build --configuration production`
Deployed to `/public_html/studio-booker/`

.htaccess routes all paths to index.html
Always show details

```apache

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteCond %{{REQUEST_FILENAME}} !-f
  RewriteCond %{{REQUEST_FILENAME}} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

---

# Potential Improvements

- Backend database (e.g., Firebase, Node.js, Laravel)
- Authentication & user accounts
- Admin panel for booking management
- Online payments with Stripe or PayPal
- Email confirmations
