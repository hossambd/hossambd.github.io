## Post 4a: Auth API Layer & Environment Decoupling
Your UI should never know where the authentication comes from.

A recap of what we're building, we already have the UI components integrated and useAuth handling states / effects and offering context managine the session truth. We dont yet have the boundary between what the app does and where the data comes from which we handle using the Auth API. This asspect is a separation termed decoupling.

### The Framework of authAPI.ts
authApi.ts

Firstly without any such separater our fetch logic can leak into and from hooks. Additionally the testing framework becomes more difficult because they need a server to support it.  Environments become hard-coded making portability more cumbersome and refactoring components can cause breaks everywhere. 

When we implement an auth entication logic within the feature, it becomes portable, test with ease and swaping back ends is simple to fire up again in production environments where this setup matters.

So from a coding stand point, what authAPI is, is a thin service layer connecting back ends to the interfaces 

```text
UI → useAuth → authApi → Backend

```
The UI never sees fetch. useAuth never sees urls and the backend can change without touching the app.

### Auth API Boundary Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  UI --> useAuth
  useAuth --> authApi

  authApi -->|fetch| Backend
  Backend -->|response| authApi

  authApi -->|normalized result| useAuth
  useAuth -->|state update| UI

```

**Takeaways:**
- Only one file knows about endpoints
- Only one place handles headers
- Only one abstraction touches the network

--- 

### Fetch Wrapper: One Door In, One Door Out

Every auth request should go through the same function.

Conceptually:
```js
request(endpoint, options) → normalized result
```

This lets you:

- handle errors once
- standardize JSON parsing
- mock easily
- add logging later

---

### 🧪 Diagram: Fetch Wrapper Responsibility

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Request --> AuthApi
  AuthApi -->|add headers| Fetch
  Fetch -->|raw response| AuthApi

  AuthApi -->|parse JSON| Normalize
  Normalize -->|success or error| Caller
```
**Key rule**

- ❌ No fetch() in components
- ❌ No fetch() in hooks
- ✅ Only inside authApi

---

### Token Handling (Without Security Theater)

This series intentionally avoids:

- pretending localStorage is secure
- over-engineered token vaults
- false guarantees

---

#### Reality:

- Frontend tokens are session hints
- Real security lives on the backend
- The goal is consistency, not illusion

---

#### Token responsibilities in the frontend:

- store
- attach to requests
- clear on logout
- Nothing more.

---

### Diagram: Token Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  LoginSuccess --> Token
  Token -->|store| Storage
  Storage -->|rehydrate| AuthContext

  AuthApi -->|read token| Storage
  Storage -->|attach header| Request

  Logout -->|clear| Storage
```

The file structure looks similar to the below by separating `auth` directory from `api`

```text
src/
├─ app/
│  ├─ App.jsx
│  └─ Router.jsx
│
├─ context/
│  └─ AuthContext.jsx
│
├─ features/
│  └─ api/
│     ├─ hooks/
│     │  └─ useLogin.js
│     ├─ services/
│     │  └─ authApi.js
│     ├─ validators/
│     │  └─ loginSchema.js
│     ├─ tests/
│     │  ├─ LoginForm.test.jsx
│     │  └─ useLogin.test.js
│     └─ index.js
│
└─ main.jsx

```


---

### Mocking APIs in Tests (This Is the Win)

Because authApi is isolated:

- tests do not need a server
- hooks are testable
- UI is deterministic
- You can replace the entire backend with a mock.

---

### Diagram: Real vs Mock Backend Swap

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  useAuth --> authApi

  authApi -->|real env| RealBackend
  authApi -->|test env| MockBackend
```
Environment decides behavior — not code paths.

--- 

### Environment Decoupling

Your app should never care whether it’s:

- local
- staging
- production
- test

That decision lives in one place.

```js
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
```

Or replaced entirely during tests.

### Whats Next

Our next post in the Login Series [API Endpoints]({% post_url 2026-01-06-react-login-04-auth-api-endpoints %}) discusses break down of api endpoints, structuring the api depending on which architectural need and prepare our system for coding the api.
